Globbing:
- ${VAR#pattern}  :: delete shortest match from beginning
: file='sdf/fd' && echo ${file#sdf/}
- ${VAR##pattern}  :: delete longest match from beginning
- ${VAR%pattern}  :: delete shortest match from end
- ${VAR%%pattern}  :: delete longest match from end
- ${VAR/search/replace} :: Regex replacement (kinda?)
Examples:
- ${VAR:*}   :: retain the part before the last colon
- ${VAR##*/} :: retain the basename
- ${VAR%.*}  :: remove extension
- [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/486694][argument from end of list]] ::
  : eval x=\$$(($#-1))
  (uses arithmetic substitution, a non-POSIX feature)
