When setting org-id-method to 'ts or 'org,
org-attach seems to use org-attach-id-ts-folder-format
to create its hierarchy.

However I tend to customize IDs for important files by hand,
causing any attempt to use org-attach on that file to fail
if the ID is shorter than six characters:

    org-attach-id-ts-folder-format: Args out of range: "ftt", 0, 6

This method should be adjusted to handle non-ts-ids just as well,
as org-id-method does not dictate the format of existing ids.
