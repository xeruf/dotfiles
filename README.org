* Dotfiles
I mainly use Arch Linux,
currently with the KDE desktop environment
with the intention to move to Awesome soon.
** Root
I am trying to keep my home clean,
but some files unfortunately cannot be moved.
Out of these, only [[.zprofile][.zprofile]] is of interest,
it contains lots of mappings to store files according to XDG
and configuration for ~less~ and ~fzf~.
** .config
- [[.config/shell][shell]] :: shell aliases & functions grouped into a few different areas, focused on zsh but mostly usable with bash
- doom :: [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] configuration with personalized snippets
- ideavim, vifm, nvim :: vi-related tools
- git, yadm :: version control
** .local
- [[.local/bin/scripts][scripts]] :: lots of useful scripts, most have a short documentation header - including many essential git scripts
