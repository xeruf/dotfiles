* Dotfiles
I mainly use Arch Linux,
currently with the KDE desktop environment
with the intention of moving a tiling WM (Awesome or Sway) soon.

If you are looking to snag some of my handy tools,
focus on [[.local/bin/scripts]] and [[.config/shell]].
Among daily use are ~b~, ~edbin~, ~edconf~, ~edit~, ~help~, [[.config/shell/arch][~yas~]]
and [[https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide][zoxide]]-based ~d~ / ~di~
which in turn use ~zfz~, ~zf~ & ~locz~.

~ex~, ~m~, ~moul~, ~rpl~, ~s~, ~sd~, ~tl~, ~walli~ are also commonly used conveniences.
** Root
I am trying to keep my home clean,
but some files unfortunately cannot be moved.
Out of these, only [[.zprofile][.zprofile]] is of interest,
it contains lots of mappings to store files according to XDG
and configuration for ~less~ and ~fzf~.
** .config
- [[.config/shell][shell]] :: shell aliases & functions grouped into a few different areas, focused on zsh but mostly usable with bash
- [[.config/zsh][zsh]] :: zsh plugin configuration & custom completions
- [[.config/doom][doom]] :: [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] configuration with personalized snippets
- ideavim, vifm, nvim :: vi-related tools
- git, yadm :: version control
** .local
- [[.local/bin/scripts][scripts]] :: lots of useful scripts,
  most have a short documentation header -
  including many essential git scripts
