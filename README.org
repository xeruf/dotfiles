* Dotfiles
I mainly use Arch Linux,
currently with the KDE desktop environment
with the intention to move to Awesome soon.

If you are looking to snag some of my handy tools,
focus on [[.local/bin/scripts]] and [[.config/shell]].
Among daily use are ~b~, ~edbin~, ~edconf~, ~edit~, ~yas~, ~walli~
and [[https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide][zoxide]]-based ~d~ / ~di~
which in turn use ~zfz~, ~zf~ & ~locz~.

~ex~, ~help~, ~moul~, ~mvk~, ~rpl~, ~s~, ~sd~, ~tl~ are also commonly used conveniences.
** Root
I am trying to keep my home clean,
but some files unfortunately cannot be moved.
Out of these, only [[.zprofile][.zprofile]] is of interest,
it contains lots of mappings to store files according to XDG
and configuration for ~less~ and ~fzf~.
** .config
- [[.config/shell][shell]] :: shell aliases & functions grouped into a few different areas, focused on zsh but mostly usable with bash
- [[.config/zsh][zsh]] :: zsh plugin configuration & custom completions
- [[.config/doom][doom]] :: [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] configuration with personalized snippets
- ideavim, vifm, nvim :: vi-related tools
- git, yadm :: version control
** .local
- [[.local/bin/scripts][scripts]] :: lots of useful scripts, most have a short documentation header - including many essential git scripts
